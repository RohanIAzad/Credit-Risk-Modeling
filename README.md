# Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a Probability of Default (PD) model using the Lending Club dataset (2007-2015). The dataset contains detailed loan information, including borrower characteristics and loan performance. The goal is to predict loan default risk and build a credit scorecard for risk assessment.

# Steps Followed
## 1. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
1. Handled missing values and created dummy variables for categorical features.
2. Applied Weight of Evidence (WoE) transformation and calculated Information Value (IV) to assess variable significance.
3. Selected reference categories based on the lowest WoE values.

## 2. Building the Probability of Default (PD) Model

Defined the target variable:
Good (1): Loan is not in default.
Bad (0): Loan is in default.
Grouped numerical and categorical variables based on WoE distribution.
Split the dataset into 75% training and 25% test sets.
Built a Logistic Regression model and selected statistically significant variables.
Evaluated the model using ROC AUC = 0.6953 (at 0.9 threshold).

## 3. Scorecard Development
Converted model predictions into a credit score ranging from 300 to 850.
Transformed logistic regression coefficients into scorecard points using:

Applied matrix multiplication to calculate individual scores.

## 4. Approval & Rejection Analysis
Derived approval and rejection rates based on PD thresholds.
At a 10% PD cutoff (90% probability of being good):
Approval rate: 53.94%
Rejection rate: 46%

## 5. Model Validation
Calculated Population Stability Index (PSI) to monitor model drift and assess the need for retraining with new data.

## Key Takeaways
WoE and IV helped in variable selection and transformation for better predictive power.
Logistic Regression effectively modeled PD and facilitated scorecard development.
The scorecard provides a transparent risk assessment framework for loan approvals.
PSI validation ensures long-term model reliability.
